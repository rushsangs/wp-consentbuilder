\section{SUMMARY}
\label{sec:summary}
You are being invited to take part in a research study. This study is a multi-site study, meaning it will take place
at several different locations. Because this is a multi-site study this consent form includes two parts. Part 1 of
this consent form is the Master Consent and includes information that applies to all study sites. Part 2 of the
consent form is the Study Site Information and includes information specific to the study site where you are being
asked to enroll. Both parts together are the legal consent form and must be provided to you.

{You and your child are being asked to take part in a research study. Participating in the study is voluntary. This means you can choose whether or not you want your child to continue. 

Before you decide it is important for you to know why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. 
Take time to decide whether or not you will allow your child to take part in this study. If you decide to allow your child to participate in the study, you will be asked to sign this form.

This study involves children who are temporarily ill. The illness is a common infection like pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infection, urinary tract infection, or gastroenteritis.  The purpose of this study is to compare two types of follow-up strategies for these children: 1) Automatic follow-up, in which the child is told to visit their regular doctor within 7 days of leaving the hospital even if they are better. 2) As-needed follow-up, in which the child's family pursues a wait and see approach and only makes a follow-up appointment if the child is not getting better at home or is getting worse. Both approaches can work well. Both are used by doctors.  We want to figure out which one is best for children and their families.

\section{STUDY BACKGROUND}
\label{sec:background}
{  \textbf{\textit{Why is this research being done?}} 
When a child leaves the hospital, doctors at the hospital routinely tell parents to schedule a follow-up visit with their child's regular doctor.  The visit usually happens within one week. Families visit the doctor even if the child's symptoms improve or they get better. This is called automatic follow-up. These appointments have potential benefits.  During these visits, the child's doctor can assess the child's recovery and change the treatment, if needed. The doctor can also talk to the child and their family. 
However, follow-up visits can be hard for families. Often, parents have already taken time away from work and other responsibilities while their child is hospitalized. A routine follow-up visit can mean more missed work for parents, missed school for the child, and increased costs from copays and travel to the visit. 
A different approach is as-needed follow-up. This is when the doctor tells the parents if their child continues to get better, they do not need a follow-up appointment. Parents are also instructed to take their child to a follow-up visit if they do not improve or get worse. In other words, as-needed follow-up empowers families to decide if and when their child needs a follow-up appointment.

\section{STUDY PROCEDURES}
\label{sec:studyprocedures}
{  \textbf{\textit{What happens in this study?}} 
As a parent and/or guardian you will be asked to participate in answering a series of questions as your role as a caregiver. If you choose to enroll your child into this study, a parent interview will take place. This interview will occur while you are at the hospital.  We will ask for information about your child like age, race, ethnicity, financial hardship.
At the time of hospital discharge, your child will be randomly assigned to either as-needed follow-up or automatic follow-up. Random means assigned by chance, like the flip of a coin. You have a 50-50 chance of being in either group.  We will inform you what follow-up group you are assigned to. 
The instructions for the follow-ups are below:
 
\begin{compactitem}
\item\uline{As-needed follow-up} "You do not need to schedule a follow-up visits with your child's regular doctor. If your child's illness continues to improve, you do not need to have a visit with your child's regular doctor. If your child's illness does not seem to be getting better or you develop any new concerns, we recommend that you contact your child's regular doctor. Discuss with the doctor whether a follow-up visit might be necessary."
\item\uline{Automatic follow-up} "Please schedule a follow-up visit with your child's regular doctor before leaving the hospital. Please schedule the visit to occur within the next 7 days and plan to attend the visit even if your child's illness is getting better."
\end{compactitem}

After leaving the hospital you will be asked to complete four surveys.  The surveys will be sent to you: 7 days post-discharge, 14-days post-discharge, 28 days post-discharge, and 180 days post-discharge. We can text or email you survey reminders.  If surveys are not completed, we will call you to remind you to complete the survey.  
A study summary will be sent to your regular doctor. They will be notified of your child's enrollment into the study and to which follow-up arm you are randomized to. 
The researchers will continue to collect your child's medical information at least 28 days after hospital discharge.}

Being in this study is entirely voluntary.  You may withdraw your child from the study at any time. If you decide to withdraw your child's participation, it will not affect your child's current or future medical care in any way. If you choose not to continue, no further information will be collected about your child. We will continue to use the data we have already collected. 

  \textbf{\textit{What if I decide to Not Participate after I sign the Consent and Authorization Form?}} 
You can tell us anytime that you do not want your child to be in this study and do not want us to use your child's health information. You can also tell us in writing. If you change your mind, we will not be able to collect new information about your child, and your child will be withdrawn from the research study. However, we can continue to use information we have already started to use in our research, as needed to maintain the integrity of the research.

This authorization does not have an expiration date. You have a right to information used to make decisions about your child's health care. However, your information from this study will not be available during the study; it will be available after the study is finished}
